            <br><br>
            <p>Dear reader, my name is Victoria and I am the person who created this website. I created this website because in my design class, one of our assignements<br>
                was too create and code a website using html and css. For the assignement, I decided that I was going to make a<br>
                website about different flowers and gardens. </p>
